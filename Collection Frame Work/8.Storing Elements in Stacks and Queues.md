# Overview
> Java SE 5 saw the addition of a new interface in the Collections Framework: the `Queue` interface, further extended in Java SE 6 by the `Deque` interface. The `Queue` interface is an extension of the `Collection` interface.

## 1.Stack (LIFO – Last In, First Out)
#### **Hierarchy of Stack in Java:**
```java
java.util.Collection
        ↑
java.util.List
        ↑
java.util.Vector
        ↑
java.util.Stack
```
- **A Stack follows the LIFO principle.**
- Operations:
  - `push(element)`: Adds an element to the top.
  - `pop()`: Removes the top element
  - `peek()`: Views the top element without removing it.
- **Example of Stack Operations:**
```java
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

// Push elements
stack.push(10);
stack.push(20);
stack.push(30);

System.out.println("Top element (peek): " + stack.peek()); // 30
System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop()); // 30
System.out.println("Stack after pop: " + stack);//[10, 20]
```
#### FAQ: 
 ##### Why new Stack<>() for Stack? 
1. `Stack` is a concrete class, so we can directly instantiate it.
2. It extends `Vector`, which provides thread safety but is not the most efficient choice
3. **Modern Alternative:** `Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();`
4. `ArrayDeque` is recommended because it is faster and more efficient than `Stack`.
